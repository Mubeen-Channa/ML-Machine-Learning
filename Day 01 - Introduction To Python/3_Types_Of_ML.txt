        Machine Learning is categorized into three main types: 
            1) Supervised     : Already Labeled (input and output given)
            2) Unsupervised   : UnLabeled Data (outputs are not given)
            3) Reinforcement  : Learn Itself by doing (	No predefined data, learns from environment)

        
        * Data Set should be large for Accuracy.


        Supervised Learning    → Best for prediction tasks (when labeled data is available).
        Unsupervised Learning  → Best for pattern recognition in large datasets.
        Reinforcement Learning → Best for decision-making in dynamic environments.
