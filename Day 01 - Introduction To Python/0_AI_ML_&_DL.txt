Artificial Intelligence (AI):
    The simulation of human intelligence in machines to perform tasks like problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding.
    Example: Chatbots, self-driving cars, Google Assistant, Siri, Facial Recognition in smartphones, Autonomous robots.
 

Machine Learning (ML):
    A subset of AI, where algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
    Example: Recommendation systems, spam filters.


Data Science (DS)
    The field that uses scientific methods, processes, and algorithms to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.
    Example: Analyzing customer data for business insights, Predicting customer, Weather forecasting.


Relationship:
    AI uses ML to make intelligent decisions.
    ML relies on data science techniques to analyze and interpret data.
