# Python is highly recommended for ML, We can also use other programming languages.

# Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.


# Why Python for ML?
    # Easy Syntax      → Focus on logic, not complex code. (beginner-friendly)
    # Rich Libraries   → NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
    # Strong Community → Tons of tutorials, support, and pre-built models.


# Alternatives:
    # R     → Best for statistical analysis.
    # Java  → Used in enterprise ML applications.
    # Julia → Faster for numerical computing.


# Versatile: Used in web development, data science, Scientific Calculation, AI, automation, and more.


# Frist Program
print("Hello, Mubeen!")     # Output: Hello, Mubeen


# Syntax:
    # Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks instead of braces {}.

    # ✅ Correct:
    if True:
        print("Indented properly")  # 4 spaces (recommended)

    # ❌ Incorrect (IndentationError):
    if True:
        print("No indentation")         # Missing indentation
