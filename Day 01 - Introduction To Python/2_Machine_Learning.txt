    Introduction to ML:
        Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that enables computers to learn from data 
        without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing specific rules, ML models 
        identify patterns and make predictions/Decisions.

        
            Core Concepts:
            - Features:      The input variables (age, income).
            - Labels:        The output variable ("Spam" or "Not Spam").
            - Training Data: Data used to train the model.
            - Testing Data:  Data used to evaluate the model's performance.
            - Model:         The algorithm that makes predictions based on input data.
            
            Example: A model trained on housing prices might take features (size, location, number of rooms)
                    and predict the label (price).
